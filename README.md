# WEC F24 Task-Server Assigner 

This program was created for the Fall 2024 Waterloo Engineering Competition. 
The program takes two inputs, 'Server.csv' and 'Tasks.csv', and outputs 'Output.csv' and 'Simulation.csv'. 

## How To Use 
### 1 - Place CSVs 
Replace 'Server.csv' and 'Tasks.csv' with the appropriate server and tasks CSV files respectively. 
Ensure the headers of these are included in the CSV files. 
You may rename the files in main.py if you would rather have different names. 

### 2 - Run The Program
Ensure you have Python installed. 
Run 'main.py'. 

## Files Generated
The files generated will be 'Output.csv' and 'Simulation.csv'. 
If there are issues with spacing, this may be due to differences in operating system (this was designed for Windows devices, and Python handles line ending characters differently between operating systems).
